##Contributions - Chandler Ott
I have 33 commits. Some are small/quick fixes while others where more
heavy in terms of UX/UI and design. That is where I spent the
vast majority of my time since I am more experienced in front end than
back end/API calls etc.

I was a part of overall user experience as well as put together the Home
page and most of the course survey page. As UX lead, sometimes I made tiny 
changes across multiple pages to make the overall feel consistent and make
sure there are no spelling mistakes, there is ample whitespace, and other 
quirks etc.
