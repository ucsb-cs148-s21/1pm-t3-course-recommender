Project name: UCSB Course Recommender Application

Description:
A web application that helps CS students choose their course by listing a list of major courses and GE courses that they can take to count towards their graduation. 
The web app will prompt the user to select their previously completed courses. Then, using the list of courses from UCSB Developer API, the app will return a list
of courses offered next quarter that they fulfill the prequisites for and are able to take the following quarter.
