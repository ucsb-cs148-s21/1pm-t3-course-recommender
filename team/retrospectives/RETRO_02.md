# Retro #2 05/06/21

* Led by: Jessica
* Present: Justin, Ruxin, Chandler, Jiarui, Jessica

## Action item

* a goal: better frontend
* a change: we will work on managing our time better
* a measurement: a better looking app with less last-minite error to fix, be less stressful 

## Optional

* Update the Kanban board more often with subtasks everyone is working on

## Retro Assessment

* I just go over the three points above and after the MVP, we already have a lot to retrospect on. 
* It went pretty well. We come up with the goal and we agree on the change to make. 
* Maybe leading the team to retro some important event that had been through would be great. 

## Outcome
* We are doing great on making a better frontend and we manage to do work more advanced and plan better for the upcoming activities.
