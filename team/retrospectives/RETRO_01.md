* Led by: Jiarui Zhu
* Present: Justin, Ruxin, Chandler, Jiarui, Jessica

## Action item

* a goal: Get base app with both frameworks pushed to the repo
          
* a change: Our group will focus on improving communication. Whenever you have a conflict for a team meeting, let the team know ahead of time.
 Additionally, be more open about current state of the project and what everyone is working on.
                             
* a measurement: Move issue #10 and #12 from in progress to done by the end of the week.
 
## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro


## Retro Assessment
* We began the retro by asking everyone one thing we didn't do well in past. We agreed on the communication issue we had in the past and made plan to improve it. 
* The retro went well since we had successfully identified the issue and made plan to improve on it.
* For the next retro, it would be great to ask the team memebers to think ahead the issues we have in the past so we can directly discuss about them.

##Outcome
* We reached our goal by coming to meetings more prepared to minimize downtime and maximize time spent working on issues. Also, we improved our communication by staying in more frequent contact through Slack and meetings outside of section.
