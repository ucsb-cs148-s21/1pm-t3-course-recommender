# Date of Retrospective: 05/25/21

* Led by: Justin Surmani
* Present: Justin, Ruxin, Chandler, Jiarui, Jessica

## Action item

* a goal: focus on current tasks on the kanban board, finish documentation, and smoothly integrate all remaining features befor the final code freeze
          
* a change: making sure the kanban board accurately reflects the status of the feature branches (i.e. moved finished issues to done column)
                             
* a measurement: how smoothly our app appears at the end of the code freeze, and how easy it is for other groups/people to follow our documentation and installation steps
 
## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro
  - move kanban issues to reflect current state of the issue.

## Retro Assessment
* We began the retro by asking everyone one thing we should focus on in our final stretch. We agreed to focus on keeping the kanban board updated with respect to the current state of the issues . 
* The retro went well since we had successfully identified the issue and made plans to improve on before the final code freeze.

## Outcome
