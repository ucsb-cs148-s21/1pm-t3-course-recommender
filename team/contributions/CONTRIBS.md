I have 33 commits. Some are small/quick fixes while others are more
feature heavy in terms of UX/UI and design. That is where I spent the
vast majority of my time since I am more experienced in front end than
the area of back end/API calls etc.

I was a part of managing overall user experience as well as put together the Home
page and parts of the course survey page. As UX lead, I also made small
changes across multiple pages to make the overall feel consistent and make
sure there are no spelling mistakes, ample whitespace, no UI quirks etc.
