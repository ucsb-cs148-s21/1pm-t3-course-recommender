I have 75 commits. Some of these are actual updates to the codebase, while a lot
of them are adding files to document our team meetings and such. I helped facilitate and
implement our Auth0/google authentification system as well as the profile page that
you can only see when you are logged in.


## Chandler Ott
I have 33 commits. Some are small/quick fixes while others are more
feature heavy in terms of UX/UI and design. That is where I spent the
vast majority of my time since I am more experienced in front end than
the area of back end/API calls etc.

I was a part of managing overall user experience as well as put together the Home
page and parts of the course survey page. As UX lead, I also made small
changes across multiple pages to make the overall feel consistent and make
sure there are no spelling mistakes, ample whitespace, no UI quirks etc.
