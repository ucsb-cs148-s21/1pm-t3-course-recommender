## Jiarui Zhu
I have 39 commits. I initially setup the springboot backend and react frontend framework.
I setup the framework for the Survey page, Course List page, and Result page.
I setup the local storage that stores the input from user.
I setup the API all in React that gets course information data from UCSB Developer API.
I implemented algorithm that returns a list of courses that a user can take based on the course offering and user input


## Ruxin Zhang 
I have 9 commits.
As a team member who mainly worked on UI/UX design, I did the very first version of the navigation bar and did most of the current navigation bar. I fixed some small errors as well, such as the submit button didnâ€™t redirect to the Recommended Course page and some padding spaces of the elements.


## Jessica Zhang
I have 60 commits. Most of them are doing documentation such as sprint meeting logs, deploy and other in and other documents. As the Design Document Coordinator, I collect the information for most part of the document and coordinate on the chunk that I am not that familiar with and gain specific help from specific person who know about them. 

For the code part, I basically help both front-end and back-end team on wherever they need a hand. I mostly help on the API part as the backend data support and I help on the front-end submit button with the form input on the survey page. As github has been being really tricky to me, I basically sent my code to my teammate and ask them to help me upload the changes or I did pair programming with my teammates. 


## Justin Surmani
I have 75 commits. Some of these are actual updates to the codebase, while a lot
of them are adding files to document our team meetings and such. I helped facilitate and
implement our Auth0/google authentification system as well as the profile page that
you can only see when you are logged in.


## Chandler Ott
I have 33 commits. Some are small/quick fixes while others are more
feature heavy in terms of UX/UI and design. That is where I spent the
vast majority of my time since I am more experienced in front end than
the area of back end/API calls etc.

I was a part of managing overall user experience as well as put together the Home
page and parts of the course survey page. As UX lead, I also made small
changes across multiple pages to make the overall feel consistent and make
sure there are no spelling mistakes, ample whitespace, no UI quirks etc.
