Problem Scenario: 

As a CS major student, it’s painful for me to keep track of both my major requirements and GE requirements every time when I need to choose my course. I need to go back and forth between the GOLD register and my major & GE progress check so many times to fill out my schedule. It would be super convenient if I can have a list of “recommended” courses in hand that I can choose to count towards my graduation requirements.
