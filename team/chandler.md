Hey everyone! As for my brief introduction, I am a third year CS student who transferred in this past fall. I have some experience working on mobile android development as well as some data visualization on the web development side. Through this project, I hope we can create something useful to UCSB students who want to see available course options when pass times come around.

Some ideas I have for the project are as follows:
- Include filters that allow a more targeted look at the courses recommended. 
- Display ratemyprofessor ratings or a link to said professor for each course if available to allow students to quickly see that relevant information.
